    "section": "Likelihoods",
    "text": "Likelihoods\nIn this chapter, a hypothetical experiment was introduced in which an observer collects data about the proportion of water on a globe (to understand the true proportion of water on earth).\nLet \\(p\\) denote the proportion of water on the globe, \\(W\\) the number of observations that yielded “water”, and \\(L\\) the number of observations that yielded “land”. By the Binomial distribution:\n\\[\nPr(W=w,L=l\\quad|\\quad p)={w+l\\choose w}p^w(1-p)^l\n\\]\nNow presume the observer recorded \\(W=6\\) and \\(L=3\\) in nine trials. The “likelihood” of these data can be plotted as a function of probability:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is by no means a probabiltity distribution. It doesn’t sum to one; it integrates to 0.1. However the recognition of this function is a crucial step towards two possible modes of inference:\n\nIn a classical sense, this function represents an objective to maximize, then compare against a null hypothesis (often \\(H_0: p=0.5\\)).\nIn a Bayesian sense, this function represents one piece of the joint distribution of \\(W, L, p\\) (the other piece being the prior on \\(p\\)). And this is the mode of inference advocated by the book.\n\nWhen we start with a uniform prior \\(p\\sim\\text{Beta}(1, 1)\\), we end up with a posterior that looks uncannily like our likelihood function:\n\nPosteriorLikelihood (again)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re actually the same function, just with different y-axis scales. I previously didn’t realize that…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikelihoods as Objectives\n\n\n\nAs part of the classical mode of inference, one might reasonably seek to maximize the above likelihood function \\(\\mathcal{L}\\), setting \\(p=\\hat{p}\\) at maximal likelihood, then comparing the ratio of likelihoods between \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{p})\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}(p_0)\\). It turns out, when this ratio is greater than some constant \\(c\\), one would rationally conclude that \\(p\\neq p_0\\) (in other words, one rejects the null hypothesis).\n\n\nSo contrasting the two modes of inference: in the classical sense, one compares two points along the likelihood curve to posit evidence against some hypothesis \\(H_0\\). In a Bayesian sense, one obtains a posterior distribution over plausible values of \\(p\\), which can be further analyzed for compatability with any set of hypotheses. And the realization for me (at least in this trivial example) is that the likelihood and posterior functions are the exact same shape.\nReflecting on this a little more, I can understand how the relative simplicity of the classical approach might be appealing at the start of a scientific inquiry, say, when we don’t know much about the phenomenon but expect to learn a lot quickly. However, when an inquiry matures to the point of having data readily available, it seems silly to forgo the benefit of having the entire distribution of a parameter available to interrogate. It’s clear that the latter offers a richer description of the unknown phenomenon. Perhaps an analogy would be like entering a dark cavernous tunnel, where the classical approach affords you looks at two possible paths forward (one of which is a dead-end and the other quite a promising lead). The Bayesian approach, on the other hand, affords you something like a map of multiple paths forward."

    "section": "Algorithms for Posterior Approximation",
    "text": "Algorithms for Posterior Approximation\nI was previously aware of posterior approximation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but I was surprised to learn about two viable alternatives to numerically sampling from a posterior distribution.\nI’ll continue with the hypothetical experiment from the previous section in which we are aiming to estimate \\(p\\), the proportion of water on the globe.\n\nGrid ApproximationQuadratic ApproximationMCMC\n\n\nBy selecting a finite grid across the support of our parameter \\(p\\), we can approximate the posterior:\n\n\nCode\ngrid.seq &lt;- seq(0, 1, length.out=20)\nprior &lt;- dunif(grid.seq)\nlikelihood &lt;- dbinom(6, size=9, prob=grid.seq)\nposterior &lt;- prior * likelihood / sum(prior * likelihood)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis technique involves leveraging a Gaussian approximation of the posterior near its mode. I believe the theory behind it is related to the efficiency property2 of MLEs, which states that the MLE converges in distribution to a normal distribution at larger sample sizes. It is relatively easy to code up using the quap function from the textbook’s rethinking package:3\n\n\nCode\nposterior &lt;- rethinking::quap(\n  alist(\n    W ~ dbinom(W+L ,p) ,\n    p ~ dunif(0, 1)),\n  data=list(W=6,L=3) )\nquad.post &lt;- rethinking::precis(posterior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally MCMC, which is the most-widely adopted approach to posterior approximation, has many algorithmic variants. The following is an example of the Metropolis Algorithm:4\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1818)\nn.samples &lt;- 2000\np &lt;- rep(NA, n.samples)\np[1] &lt;- 0.5\nobs.data &lt;- list(W=6, L=3)\nfor (i in 2:n.samples){\n  p.new &lt;- rnorm(1 , p[i - 1] , 0.1)\n  if (p.new &lt; 0) p.new &lt;- abs(p.new)\n  if (p.new &gt; 1) p.new &lt;- 2 - p.new\n  q0 &lt;- dbinom(obs.data$W, obs.data$W + obs.data$L, p[i-1])\n  q1 &lt;- dbinom(obs.data$W, obs.data$W + obs.data$L, p.new)\n  p[i] &lt;- ifelse(runif(1) &lt; q1/q0, p.new, p[i-1])\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one intruiging feature of the Metropolis algorithm is the acceptance rule, which computes a ratio of likelihoods, given \\(p\\) and \\(p'\\), and accepts the new value \\(p'\\) if this ratio is above some randomly-generated value.\nIn other words, the internal mechanics of the algorithm work a bit like the classical approach to inference (see above), in which the likelihoods of two points are compared. In the classical approach, \\(\\hat{p}\\) is never technically “accepted”, but \\(p_0\\) can be rejected if the ratio of likelihoods (\\(\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{p})\\) vs. \\(\\mathcal{L}(p_0)\\)) is above some constant \\(c\\). In contrast to MCMC, however, \\(c\\) is not randomly-generate but instead dictated by the choice of \\(\\alpha\\), which is commonly 0.05."

At CBICA, I developed an early interest in statistical image analysis, particularly in normalizing imaging-derived features over multiple scanners and diverse geographic sites. In the imaging literature, this is referred to as harmonization, and there are a growing number of techniques available to implement harmonization. My most significant contribution was in developing a tool that adapts the popular ComBat1 algorithm to lifespan datasets encompassing broad age ranges, with potentially complex age trends in brain volumetry. Today, that tool is available on GitHub as a python package, and it is used by neuroimaging researchers to handle common harmonization tasks like removing site effects in regional brain volumes data.\nIn addition to my work on harmonization, I assisted with image analysis in several other projects that resulted in peer-reviewed publications from the following first authors:\n\nDr. Ilya M.

I was fortunate to work with excellent clinical collaborators at PTraC, including specialists in lung transplant, severe asthma, and pulmonary hypertension.

Data types were highly heterogeneous and included electronic health records, insurance claims, and a national disease registry.

Missing data are common yet complicated by enormous heterogeneity; missing data can arise at various stages within a study, and they present so many challenges that practitioners often ignore missing data altogether. In my time at Colorado, I encountered missing data in observational studies due to participant dropout or early mortality. When working with this kind of missing data, I often used multiple imputation by chained equations2 to replace missing observations with values that would be realistic given the remaining data. This technique works well when certain assumptions are met and is conveniently implemented inR by the mice package.\nHowever, another kind of missing data can arise in studies investigating pre-post differences that fail to collect unique identifiers for each participant. For my master’s thesis at Colorado, I analyzed techniques to handle this particular case of paired inference, which we refer to as ‘partially matched’ data.

These areas excite me by presenting an opportunity to integrate my undergraduate business experience with cutting-edge data science methods. I’ve begun to work a little in these areas as an independent consultant through Upwork (a freelancing platform), and I hope that I can continue to find work with clients who value my insight in diverse and wide-ranging projects.\nIn 2024, I look forward to beginning a new position as a data scientist at SygnaMap, a bio-tech startup based in San Antonio.

On most of my climbing trips, I log ascents in the iPhone app, which syncs with my profile online. This has generally been something I treated as a personal journalling exercise, and I figured I would someday want to look back on my ascents to see how far I’ve come in the sport/adventure of rock climbing.\nRecently, I’ve been focused on physical training to improve my climbing performance outside, and the data that I’ve gathered over the past five years would seem to be an invaluable asset. It turns out that I’m not alone, and many other climbers use the same features on Mountain Project to log their ascents, also known as ‘ticks’ on the site\n\n\n\nThe publicly-available ticks for a route called ‘Scenic Adult’ (5.11c) at the New River Gorge in West Virginia, as of this post (November 2024)\n\n\nThere remains a challenge in leveraging this data, though, which is that metrics of historical climbing performance are not very quantifiable – and those that are quantitative are generally not sophisticated, like Max Redpoint Grade, or Hardest Flash. Those who spend a lot of time in climbing gyms will be familiar with these ideas. In essence, these metrics are akin to asking a runner what their best marathon time is, which can tell you a lot about someone’s running ability. However, it tells you less about how they’ve progressed over time and how they’ve spent their effort to arrive at their current performance level. These questions are more nuanced, and in climbing are arguably more important than just knowing someone’s maximum performance."

While being subject to a fair bit of subjectivity, the grade of a rock climb is usually a reliable measure of how difficult that route will be for the average person.\nThe pyramid tool can help visualize how a climber devotes her finite resources (e.g., time) to climbing routes of a particular grade range. It is a snapshot in time of how well-balanced a climber’s performance is, with a ‘top-heavy’ shape suggesting a climber focuses most of his time on difficult routes, and a ‘bottom-heavy’ shape suggesting he should probably try more difficult routes. There’s a lot of insight to be gained by seeing your own pyramid, and to illustrate an example here is my pyramid as of this writing:\n\n\n\nMy climbing pyramid, as of November 2024, with ‘successful’ ascents highlighted in red and failed attempts highlighted in blue.\n\n\nI am no expert but I have an intuition that my climbing pyramid is fairly typical of people at my ability level, with a few unique quirks such as the fact that I’ve spent a lot of time climbing routes at the grade of 5.11a. Additionally, while my max redpoint grade is currently 5.12a, I still have room to reinforce my experience at the grades just below that, namely 5.11c and 5.11d. These are just a few of the takeaways from quickly analyzing my own pyramid."

This trend is particularly noticeable in the postseason, where managers are tempted to pull their starters in favor of a reliever to get out of a defensive jam. In this post I will use survival analysis to study the timing of starting pitcher replacements in the postseason. I will also introduce the concepts of censoring and survival curves as they relate to starting pitcher replacements.

    "text": "Survival Analysis: A brief overview\nThe goal of survival analysis is to understand the factors that lead to earlier (or later) event times. In a medical context, the event is often mortality (i.e., death of the patient). In this sense, medical researchers are typically most-concerned with the factors that lead to earlier mortality, or longer survival, hence the name ‘survival’ analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Kaplan-Meier method illustrates the survival probabilities of two cohorts in a randomized trial (treatment and control). The NCSS software website provided this figure, along with a helpful overview of survival analysis. Source: https://www.ncss.com/software/ncss/survival-analysis-in-ncss/\n\n\nSurvival analysis is particularly useful when studying time-related phenomena with many possible risk factors, and when observational data are available. In professional sports, risk factors might be understood as game situations, i.e., what situations lead to a higher chance of the outcome? Data availability is usually not an issue, since events are now tracked to the play-level, and sometimes even greater levels of granularity.\nThere aren’t many examples of survival analysis applied to baseball, though one example studied how the length of player careers varied based upon the handedness of the player.1 In that analysis, the event of interest was the end of the player’s career; the unit of time was days. This analysis could help answer questions like, which throwing handedness tends to yield longer careers in the major leagues? (Spoiler: the author found, on average, right-handed throwers teneded to last a little longer than lefties).\nSurvival analysis includes a lot of the same features of linear regression. Linear regression is at the foundation of statistical learning. It is used in advanced baseball metrics to adjust for factors like league-to-leage variability or positional differences.2 Importantly, survival analysis extends that framework to study events that are time-dependent, like the length of a player’s career. Studying career lengths with linear regression would be prone to certain kinds of bias, since career lengths are not normally-distributed.3\nIn the next section I will describe the data that were prepared to analyze starting pitcher replacements in the postseason."

    "text": "Data: Play-by-play from Retrosheet\nFor this analysis, I used play-by-play data from Retrosheet4 to construct a set of starting pitcher histories in the postseason. This required parsing the play-by-play events to identify game situations, such as the number of runners on base. It also required processing roster information to identify the handedness of the pitchers and batters they faced. In fact this data cleaning process was intensive, since the play-by-play data are minimally-structured and contain only enough information to re-create the context of a particular game after applying a considerable amount of processing. Documentation for the play-by-play files is available5 and was extremely helpful in this stage of the analysis.\nI chose to focus on the twenty postseasons between 2000 and 2019. This was for a few reasons. First, the more-recent postseasons since 2019 have been impacted by COVID-19 and major league rule changes, such as the pitch clock. I wanted to ensure my analysis was not complicated by any of those effects. Secondly, the postseasons before 2000 are now so long ago that strategies around managing a starting pitcher are substantially different. Thus, I focus on 2000-2019 as a relatively stable, modern era of postseason play. Within this window there were 611 postseason games available to analyze.\nHere’s what every postseason game log contains, after data processing was performed:\n\nLeague (e.g., NL/AL/World Series)\nPlayoff round\nPlayoff game number\nThe starting pitcher for each team\nA record of all plate appearances facing each starter, and outcomes (e.g., home-run, fly out)\nA running tally of the number of pitches thrown by each starter\nA running tally of the number of strikeouts achieved by each starter\nThe handedness of the pitcher and batter\n\nThe above list is incomplete since it does not contain crucial variables like the matchup history between a given batter and pitcher. However, I felt that the list was sufficient for beginning an inquiry into starting pitchers and the factors that affect their replacement. In the next few sections, I will define the key variables of interest for the analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example of the game log for the 2019 NLCS (STL vs. WSH, game 4). Patrick Corbin was on the mound for the Nationals when Yadier Molina solo homer’d in the fourth inning. The Nats went on to win 7-4 behind Corbin’s 12-strikeout start."

    "text": "Defining the Event of Interest\nIn the playoffs, the time of replacing the starting pitcher is one of the most crucial decisons faced by managers. Here is what sportswriter Jasyon Stark wrote about “hooks” in the wake of a catastrophic collapse of the Red Sox’s pitching in game seven of the 2003 ALCS:\n\nFor managers and the pitchers they manage, this is the question: Take him out, or leave him in? It is the question that hangs over every manager every game of every season. It is the question that leaves canyons under their eyes and fault lines in their forehead.6\n\nRed Sox manager Grady Little had just been fired after the team ended their season on a blown lead against the Yankees. Little’s decision to leave Pedro Martinez on the mound in the eighth inning was the turning point that contributed to their loss.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Kevin Cash’s decision to pull Blake Snell in game six of the 2020 World Series ultimately backfired. Managers face consequential decisions like this throughout the playoffs, especially in high leverage situations. Photo: Tim Heitman (USA Today).\n\n\nIn the modern era, complete games are increasingly rare. In the dataset described in the previous section, of the 1218 starts analyzed, only 33 (2.7%) resulted in complete games. Thus managers are usually grappling with when to pull the starter, not if they should pull the starter. Of course, in the heat of the moment of a playoff game, this decision can resemble the form of a binary choice for each batter faced. In that sense, it’s like flipping a coin at the beginning of each plate appearance. The manager keeps flipping the coin (with a low probabilitiy of tails), and it continues to show heads. However flip the coin enough times and eventually it shows tails. When this happens, the starter gets pulled.\nI’m not suggesting that managers are actually flipping coins to guide them through highly consequential decisions, but to an outside observer, the process of starting pitcher replacements can be thought of as a random process. In this analysis, I will define the random process as the replacement of the starter, and I will model the timing of that event using information available throughout the game, including the in-game performance of the pitcher and the opposing team’s offense. Next I will define the unit of time used to measure how late into the game a starter will play."

    "section": "Defining the Unit of Time",
    "text": "Defining the Unit of Time\nIn most survival analyses, the unit of time is apparent from the context. For example, in a study of biomedical treatments for cancer, it would make sense to measure time in years, since patients would be expected to survive for multiple years after receiving treatment. In the previously mentioned analysis of players’ career lengths, time was measured in days. Whether days or years are used doesn’t really matter. The point is that time was measured with clock time.\nContrast this with starting pitcher performances, where it doesn’t make sense to measure time in minutes or hours, because baseball is not a sport with a running clock. What is the appropriate choice for a unit of time in measuring how long a starter lasts? Innings pitched? Batters faced? Pitches thrown? The answer is not so obvious, and the choice time units requires some careful thinking.\nConsider that most starting pitchers are evaluated on innings pitched. You’d like to see a workhorse starter throw for more innings, on average. But in baseball, there is no uniform length of an inning. In fact, two innings may last very different lengths of time, determined by relative offensive and defensive performance. For that reason, innings pitched is not the most appropriate unit of time for this analysis.\nInstead of innings pitched, the number of batters faced is a relevant proxy for time. Pitchers may throw different numbers of pitches, but you can generally expect a pitcher to throw about 3.8 pitches per batter faced in the long run. Additionally, pitchers are often replaced before facing a new batter, not mid-way through an at-bat.7 Lastly, the number of batters faced can easily be converted to times through the order (TTO); simply divide the number of batters by nine. Thus the number of batters faced is a sensible choice for the unit of time.\nThe following plot shows the distribution of the number of total batters faced (TBF) for all of the playoff starters in the dataset. The small number of complete games is illustrated by the tightly-grouped cluster at the right end of the distribution. Overall, starters tended to face between 20 and 30 batters, and rarely faced more than 35 batters. However, there was a substantial amount of starters that were pulled early, i.e., between 10 and 20 batters faced.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Number of batters faced by all starters in the 2000-2019 postseasons. There were 1,218 starts, of which 33 resulted in complete games (2.7%)."

    "text": "Censoring: Handling complete games\nWhen using survival analysis methods, one has to consider the possibility that the event does not occur within the observation window. In medical contexts, this might be good news for the patient; fewer events mean fewer deaths. In this analysis, the replacement of a starting pitcher in the postseason is extremely common. The small number of complete games means we could probably ignore them altogether without much of an effect on the results.\nHowever, what if we wanted to include complete games in our analysis anyways? The methods of survival analysis are well-equipped to handle these observations. In the context of this analysis, complete games are considered censored observations, because the game ended before the starting pitcher was replaced. Survival analysis will not ignore the censored observations, it turns out, and instead each model will use data from complete games to inform an understanding of what makes a starter more likely to get pulled.\nI should mention, the implicit assumption of censoring is that the event would have occurred if we were to continue observing the phenomenon into perpetuity. In baseball, this assumption is somewhat questionable since complete games imply that the starter was not replaced. But imagine if the opposing team were to tie the game and send it into extra innings. Eventually, it would become more likely that the starter would be replaced, even if he is pitching very well, because of fatigue and injury risk."

    "section": "Kaplan-Meier Method for Replacing Starters",
    "text": "Kaplan-Meier Method for Replacing Starters\nThe Kaplan-Meier procedure8 helps to estimate the speed of a ‘survival’ process, like the process of replacing starting pitchers described earlier in this post. The Kaplan-Meier method is usually illustrated with one or more ‘curves’. The curves in this case are functions that represent estimated probabilities of survival at various stages in the process. The higher the estimated probability, the more likely one is to survive until that particular point in time.\nBefore jumping to the Kaplan-Meier curves for this dataset, it’s worth considering which variable to stratify; there are a number of choices including league, series, and pitcher handedness. The point of stratification is to examine whether survival patterns vary between different strata of the overall dataset. In the figure below I stratified by season, but grouped seasons into five-year eras starting with 2000-2004. Therefore there are a total of four strata: 2000-04, 2005-09, 2010-14, and 2015-19.\nThe following plot shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the probability of replacing a starting pitcher in the postseason, stratified by season era. The curves are plotted against the number of batters faced, which is the unit of time that was chosen earlier. The curves begin at zero on the \\(x\\)-axis, because it is impossible for a starter to be replaced before the first batter. The curves end at about 40, because that was the highest number of total batters faced in any postseason game during this period.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Kaplan-Meier curves illustrating the probability of remaining in a postseason game, for starters in the 2000-2019 era. Curves are stratified by 5-year windows. The unit of time is the number of total batters faced (TBF).\n\n\nThe most obvious pattern in the above picture is that the purple curve, representing 2015-2019, is shifted to the left of the other three curves. This era is the latest in the dataset, and the shifted curve suggests that starters tended to be replaced earlier in the game during the last five seasons. Another cue is taken from the point where the curves cross a probability of 50% (when the \\(y\\)-axis reads 0.5); this is the estimated median survival time. For the season eras between 2000 and 2014, the median number of batters faced was 26. For the 2015-19, however, the median TBF was 23. That suggests pitchers were pulled about three batters earlier in the game during the latter era, compared with the earlier era.\nIs a difference of three batters meaningful? I’d argue yes, since a lot can happen in in just one or two plate appearances, particularly in high-leverage moments with the game on the line. But another important question is whether the difference is statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier method answers that question, too. I applied the log-rank test which assesses whether there is a difference between the four curves. The \\(p\\)-value of the test was very small (&lt; 0.001), meaning the difference is statistically significant.\nAlthough this preliminary analysis suggests that starting pitchers did not last as long during the 2015-19 era as they did in previous eras, there are additional factors that we might consider relevant. For example, did something else change in the style of play that made managers more likely to pull their starters early? In a future post I will address the possibility of confounding factors using a statistical method called Cox Proportional Hazards regression."
