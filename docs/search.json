    "text": "Theme 1: Computational Research\n\n\n\nFigure from Pomponio et al. (2020): Age trends for selected brain volumes using a statistically harmonized dataset with 18 studies spanning the age range 3–96.\n\n\n\nComputational Neuroimaging Research\nIn 2018, I began working at CBICA, a computational neuroimaging lab at the University of Pennsylvania, led by Dr. Christos Davatzikos. At CBICA, I developed an early expertise in statistical image analysis, particularly in the challenges of normalizing imaging-derived features over multiple scanners and geographic sites. In the imaging literature, this is referred to as harmonization, and there are a growing number of techniques available to implement harmonization techniques. My major contribution was to develop a tool that adapted the popular ComBat1 algorithm to lifespan datasets encompassing vast age ranges, with potentially complex age trends in brain volumetry. Today, that tool is available on GitHub as a python package, and it is used by neuroimaging researchers to handle common harmonization tasks like removing site effects.\nIn addition to my work on harmonization, I assisted with image analysis in several other projects that resulted in peer-reviewed publications by the following first authors:\n\nDr. Ilya M.

I was fortunate to work with excellent clinical collaborators at PTraC, including several specialists in lung transplant, severe asthma, and pulmonary hypertension. My work was characterized by generalist applications of regression models to observational data. Data types were highly heterogeneous and included electronic health records, insurance claims, and a national registry. Among the most common methods I used were survival analysis and longitudinal modeling, two popular frameworks for fitting regressions to biomedical datasets. While at PTraC, I was selected to present a lightning talk on my work at the 2022 Symposium on Statistics and Data Science in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nPublished and Accepted Papers\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on chronic disease management and patient reported outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension: The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (Pulmonary Circulation 2023)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Co-Authors: Megan Mayer, David B Badesch, Kelly H Nielsen, Steven Kawut, Todd Bull, John J Ryan, Jeffrey Sager, Sula Mazimba, Anna Hemnes, James Klinger, James Runo, John W McConnell, Teresa De Marco, Murali M Chakinala, Delphine Yung, Jean Elwing, Adolfo Kaplan, Rahul Argula, Raymond Pomponio, Ryan Peterson, Peter Hountras. \n        \n        DOI: Click to read article.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Prevalence of Alcohol Use Characterized by Phosphatidylethanol in Patients with Respiratory Failure Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic (CHEST Critical Care, 2024)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Note: This article has been accepted but is not yet published.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        Extraneous Load, Patient Census, and Patient Acuity Correlate with Cognitive Load during Intensive Care Unit Rounds (CHEST, 2024)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Note: This article has been accepted but is not yet published."

    "section": "Theme 3: Missing Data",
    "text": "Theme 3: Missing Data\nThe last theme of my research deals with missing data. Missing data are common yet complicated by enormous heterogeneity; missing data can arise at various stages within a study, and they present so many challenges that practitioners often ignore missing data altogether. In my work at Colorado, I encountered missing data in observational studies usually due to participant dropout or morbidity. When working with this kind of missing data, I typically used multiple imputation by chained equations2 to replace missing values with values that would be realistic given the remaining data. This technique works well under certain assumptions and is well-implemented inR by the mice package.\nHowever, another kind of missing data can arise in studies investigating pre-post differences that fail to collect unique identifiers for each participant. For my master’s thesis, I analyzed techniques to handle this particular case of statistical inference, which we refer to as ‘partially matched’ data. My work on this subject is currently under review, but the pre-print is below, co-authored by my thesis committee:\n\nDr. Ryan A. Peterson, Assistant Professor of Biostatistics and Informatics at the Colorado School of Public Health\nDr. Bailey K. Fosdick, Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics in the Colorado School of Public Health\nDr. Julia Wrobel, Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Emory University\n\n\nPreprint Papers\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Mistaken identities lead to missed opportunities: Testing for mean differences in partially matched data (Under Review)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Co-Authors: Raymond Pomponio, Bailey K.

    "text": "Conclusions and Next Steps\nLooking back at the past five years, it’s clear I’ve primarily worked on academic research projects with investigations into biomedical diseases and health interventions. Broadly, I’ve developed an expertise as a biostatistician and data scientist in medical research contexts.\nIf I were to speculate on the direction of the next five years, I would predict much of the same kinds of work, but with expansions into new contexts such as business and sports analytics. These areas excite me with an opportunity to integrate my undergraduate business experience with cutting edge data science skills. I’ve begun to work in these areas as an independent consultant through Upwork, and I hope that I can continue to find clients who value my insight on diverse and wide-ranging projects.\nLastly, I look forward to beginning as a data scientist at SygnaMap, a bio-tech startup based in San Antonio. At SygnaMap I will be helping to develop novel biomarkers using metabolomic profiles, which will draw on many of my past experiences in the themes above to deal with computational complexity, clinical utility, and challenges arising from missing data."
