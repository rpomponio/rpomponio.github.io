    "text": "The following work is an ongoing project, which I am submitting for presentation at the 2024 SABR Analytics Conference in Arizona.\nThe (working) title of the project is, Not If, But When: Modeling the timing of starting pitcher replacements in the postseason.\n\n\nReview of previous work on the subject: Recent sabermetrics work has observed a trend of earlier starting pitcher replacements in regular season [1, 2, 3] and postseason play [4, 5]. Earlier work modeled the in-game performance of starting pitchers, using short-term forecasts to evaluate decisions made by managers, and found that managers were far too often leaving starters in the game longer than warranted by analytics [6]. More recently, an evaluation of managers’ decisions to pull starters found no substantial biases in pulling pitchers too early or late when considering the decision’s impact on win probability [1].\nSummary of research methodology: In postseason play, the timing of starting pitcher replacements is among the most crucial decisions faced by managers, but sabermetrics has yet to model pitching replacements as time-to-event outcomes [7]. An approach that acknowledges the cumulative effect of time on the mound, as well as important in-game factors, would produce new insight into managerial decision making during highly consequential matchups. Towards this end, I modeled the time-to-replacement of starting pitchers in the 2000-2019 postseasons, controlling for in-game factors such as pitching volume, runners on base, and home runs conceded, as well as macro factors such as five-year season eras and designated hitter usage. Preliminary results: I found that starters in the 2015-19 postseason era were far more likely to be replaced against any given batter compared to the 2000-04 era (adj. Hazard Ratio: 2.69, 95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16), corroborating previous reports of a trend towards earlier starter replacements. To illustrate the magnitude of this effect, consider two typical starting pitchers (throwing 3.8 pitches per batter faced, and striking out 20% of batters). Both have faced the opposing team two times through the order (TTO), but one pitcher is in the 2000 AL and the other in the 2019 AL. The starter in 2000 would have a 70.3% chance of pitching a third TTO, while the starter in 2019 would only have a 38.8% chance of pitching a third TTO. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively; the probabilities are similar if each pitcher has conceded one home run by that point in the game (60% and 25%, respectively).\nExpected contribution to the field of baseball analytics: This work elucidates trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not yet modeled in a time-to-event fashion. Time-to-event analysis is a commonly used and flexible framework [8], enabling statistical inference of factors that contribute to earlier event times. An empirical model of managerial decision making is crucial to evaluating the effectiveness of pitching replacements; in order to ask, ‘was this a smart decision?’, we must first have a strong understanding of how other managers would have acted in similar game circumstances. This work lays foundations for advanced analytics of pitching replacements, considering time on the mound as the outcome of interest, with predictive capabilities that can be used for forecasting and post-game diagnostics.\nResearch focus: pitcher replacements, bullpen strategy, managerial decision-making.\nData Source: RetroSheet.org\n\n\n\nI grouped seasons into five-year eras, then analyzed the time-to-replacement in terms of total batters faced (TBF) for all starting pitchers in the postseason. I found that pitchers in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced earlier in the game, versus their counterparts in previous seasons.\n\n\n\nKaplan Meier curves illustrating probabilities of remaining in-game for starting pitchers in postseason games 2000-2019. The result of the log-rank test suggests a difference across season-eras.\n\n\nNext I fit a model to the postseason data, with the outcome as time-to-replacement, and included several important competitive factors such as pitching volume (pitches thrown per batter faced), strikeout rate, runners in scoring position, and handedness (differing handedness between batter and pitcher). All of the factors were computed cumulatively, i.e., I did not use data from later in the game to predict a starter’s replacement when facing a given batter. Additionally, I included season-eras and usage of designated hitters as factors in the model.\n\n\n\nEstimated hazard ratios for the ‘replacement factors’ of starting pitchers. The replacement factors are thought to influence the timing of pitcher replacements in the postseason. A hazard ratio greater than one indicates a higher likelihood of pitcher replacement.\n\n\nFinally, using the above model I estimated the chance of pitching a third time through the order (TTO) for two hypothetical starters in separate eras. The first pitcher is in the 2000-2004 era, when starters were expected to pitch relatively late in the game. The second pitcher is in the 2015-2019 era, when starters were replaced sooner in the game. The probabilities below reflect two scenarios, with the baseline scenario being no runners in scoring position (RISP) and no home runs conceded.\n\n\n\nPredicted probabilities of pitching a third time through the order for two hypothetical pitchers. The only difference between the pitchers is the era in which they play. The RISP scenario means at least one runner is in scoring position.\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] D. Finigan, B. M. Mills and D. F.
