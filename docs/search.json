    "text": "The following work has been submitted for consideration at the 2024 SABR Analytics Conference in Phoenix, Arizona: conference page.\n\n\nRecently a number of research papers have emerged examining the effects of starting pitcher replacements in Major League Baseball (MLB).1 2 3 This past year, the time through the order penalty (TTOP) was analyzed in a Bayesian framework and results were published in the Journal of Quantiative Analysis in Sports.4 There remain many questions about starting pitcher strategies, particularly in the postseason when managers’ decisions are hyper-scrutinized.5 Despite a trend towards earlier starting pitcher replacements in both regular season6 7 and postseason8 9 play, I am not aware of any analysis that has considered the replacement of the starting pitcher as a time-to-event phenomenon. The field of biostatistics has benefited greatly from the ability to model time-to-event outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, within a regression framework outlined by the late David Cox.10 Cox’s proportional hazards model is convenient for several reasons. It permits the formal modeling of a relationship between time and the event of interest; it incorporates covariates that increase or reduce the risk of the event; and, with modern software one can easily estimate the probability of an event occurring within a pre-specified time window. All of these characteristics are useful in the context of analyzing starting pitcher replacements. I will make the case that Cox’s model is more suitable for modeling pitcher replacements than alternative approaches using classification or supervised machine learning techniques.\n\n\n\nIn game seven of the 2003 ALCS, the Red Sox held a two-run lead over the Yankees in the eighth inning when manager Grady Little visited the mound.11 Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez was still in the game, with Hideki Matsui at the plate. Little decided to leave Martínez in for both Matsui and Jorge Posada, resulting in the loss of the lead and ultimately the game in 11 innings. At the time of Little’s mound visit, how likely was Martínez’s replacement? The model that is developed below suggests that Martínez would be pulled in 60.4% of games with similar circumstances.\n\n\n\nOther sabermetrics work has identified important in-game factors that predict a starter’s replacement, such as the strike count, pitch count, number of outs, total batters faced, and current home runs conceded. However, pitching replacements have not been modeled as time-to-event outcomes. Instead, they have been modeled as binary outcomes. The advantage of timing models is that the cumulative effect of time is inherent; certain factors can expedite, or delay, the timing of the event. This process is also more realistic than a binary outcomes process, which considers each event independently.\nThe first question in this analysis is, what is the unit of time? For studying outcomes in medicine, time is often measured in months or years. However, in a baseball game, no more than a few hours go by, and typically the starting pitcher is replaced mid-way through the game. I chose to use the number of batters faced as the unit of time in this analysis. While this is not a measure of clock time, it is a measure of the number of opponents that the pitcher has faced. The higher the number of opponents, the more fatigued the pitcher will become. Alternatively one could consider the number of pitches thrown as the unit of time. I don’t see any issue with this, though pitcher replacements often happen between batter plate appearanced, and pitch-by-pitch data is much more granular, potentially complicating the analysis\nFor data, I used all postseason games from 2000-2019 (source: RetroSheet.org). There were several reasons for choosing these seasons and not including more recent seasons. First, the obvious complications of the COVID-19 pandemic make working with the 2020 postseason challenging. Secondly, a number of recent rule changes have been implemented which might influence the strategy around starting pitcher replacement, for example the pitch clock. Therefore I consider the 20-year window between 2000 and 2019 to be a relatively stable period of postseason play. Future work will have to revisit the same questions explored here and see if the underlying conclusions hold up in the modern era.\nI used Cox’s proportional hazards modeling approach and controlled for in-game strikeout rate, pitching volume (pitches thrown per batter faced), runners in scoring position, and home runs conceded, as well as differences across season eras and leagues. All of the covariates included in the model were computed sequentially for each batter faced. In other words, I did not use data from later in the game to inform a covariate value earlier in the game. I grouped seasons into five-year eras (e.g., 2000-2004), then analyzed the time-to-replacement for all starting pitchers in the dataset.\n\n\n\nI found that pitchers in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced earlier in the game, versus their counterparts in previous seasons. Below is an illustration of the ‘survival probability’, or the probability of remaining in the game for a starting pitcher from four different eras. It is clear that in the most-recent era (the purple line), starting pitchers had lower probabilities of remaining in the game at each number of batters faced (TBF). The p-value printed in the lower left is a result of comparing the four curves and assessing whether one or more curves differs from the rest. It is apparent that the difference in ‘survival’ in the 2015-2019 era, versus previous eras, was statistically significant.\n\n\n\nKaplan Meier curves illustrating probabilities of remaining in-game for starting pitchers in postseason games 2000-2019. The result of the log-rank test suggests a difference across season-eras.\n\n\nBelow are the model estimates for the effect of each covariate. For example, the Cox adjusted Hazard Ratio of Season era 2015-2019 (versus 2000-2004) was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16). This means that starting pitchers in the most-recent era were 169% more likely to be replaced against any given batter, versus the 2000-2004 era. The relatively narrow confidence interval tells us that the estimated hazard ratio is reliable, i.e., if we were to replay history we would likely obtain a similar estimate.\n\n\n\nEstimated hazard ratios for the ‘replacement factors’ of starting pitchers. The replacement factors are thought to influence the timing of pitcher replacements in the postseason. A hazard ratio greater than one indicates a higher likelihood of pitcher replacement.\n\n\nTo illustrate the magnitude of the season-era effect, consider a hypothetical pitcher playing in both the 2000-2004 and the 2000-2019 eras. Assuming typical starter performance (3.8 pitches per batter faced, strikeout rate of 20%), this pitcher has a 70.3% chance of pitching a third time through the order in 2000-2004 but only a 38.8% chance of doing so in 2015-2019. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively (with one home run conceded, the probabilities are similar). The probabilities below reflect the two scenarios, with the baseline scenario being no runners in scoring position (RISP) and no home runs conceded.\n\n\n\nPredicted probabilities of pitching a third time through the order for two hypothetical pitchers. The only difference between the pitchers is the era in which they play. The RISP scenario means at least one runner is in scoring position.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work quantifies trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not modeled in a time-to-event fashion. The model has drawbacks, in that it does not capture head-to-head matchup history or differing styles of management, but those factors will be included in future work.\nLinks: GitHub | Google Scholar"

    "text": "Executive Summary\nIn game seven of the 2003 ALCS, the Red Sox held a two-run lead in the eighth inning when manager Grady Little visited the mound1. Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez was still in the game, with Hideki Matsui at the plate. Little decided to leave Martínez in for both Matsui and Jorge Posada, resulting in the loss of the lead and ultimately the game in 11 innings. At the time of Little’s mound visit, how likely was Martínez’s replacement? The following model suggests that Martínez would be pulled in 60.4% of games with similar circumstances. In postseason play, the timing of pulling a starter is the most crucial in-game decision faced by managers2. Recent sabermetrics work has identified a trend towards earlier starting pitcher replacements in regular season3 4 5 and postseason play6 7. Previous work on the topic modeled the in-game performance of starting pitchers, using short-term forecasts to evaluate managerial decisions, and found that managers were too often leaving starters in the game longer than warranted by analytics8. More recently, an evaluation of managers’ decisions found no biases in pulling pitchers too early or too late when considering effects on win probability9. Other work has identified important in-game factors that predict a starter’s replacement, such as the strike count, pitch count, number of outs, total batters faced, and current home runs conceded10. However, pitching replacements have not been modeled as time-to-event outcomes; instead, they have often been modeled as binary outcomes, as in machine learning11 12. The advantage of timing models is that the cumulative effect of time is inherent; certain factors can expedite, or delay, the timing of the event. This process is more realistic than a binary outcomes model, which considers each event independently. I modeled the time-to-replacement for starting pitchers with time as the number of batters faced, using all postseason games from 2000-2019 (source: RetroSheet.org). I used a flexible modeling approach that controls for in-game strikeout rate, pitching volume, runners in scoring position, and home runs conceded, as well as differences across season eras and leagues. I found that postseason starters in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced while facing any given batter, compared to starters in the 2000-2004 era (Cox adjusted Hazard Ratio13: 2.69, 95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16). To illustrate the magnitude of this effect, consider a hypothetical pitcher playing in both eras. Assuming typical starter performance (3.8 pitches per batter faced, strikeout rate of 20%), this pitcher has a 70.3% chance of pitching a third time through the order in 2000-2004 but only a 38.8% chance of doing so in 2015-2019. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively (with one home run conceded, the probabilities are similar). This work quantifies trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not modeled in a time-to-event fashion. The model has drawbacks, in that it does not capture head-to-head matchup history or differing styles of management, but those factors will be included in future work.\nResearch focus: pitcher replacements, bullpen strategy, managerial decision-making."

The field of biostatistics has benefited greatly from the ability to model time-to-event outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, within a regression framework outlined by the late David Cox.10 Cox’s proportional hazards model is convenient for several reasons. It permits the formal modeling of a relationship between time and the event of interest; it incorporates covariates that increase or reduce the risk of the event; and, with modern software one can easily estimate the probability of an event occurring within a pre-specified time window. All of these characteristics are useful in the context of analyzing starting pitcher replacements. I will make the case that Cox’s model is more suitable for modeling pitcher replacements than alternative approaches using classification or supervised machine learning techniques.\n\n\n\nIn game seven of the 2003 ALCS, the Red Sox held a two-run lead over the Yankees in the eighth inning when manager Grady Little visited the mound.11 Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez was still in the game, with Hideki Matsui at the plate. Little decided to leave Martínez in for both Matsui and Jorge Posada, resulting in the loss of the lead and ultimately the game in 11 innings. At the time of Little’s mound visit, how likely was Martínez’s replacement? The model that is developed below suggests that Martínez would be pulled in 60.4% of games with similar circumstances.\n\n\n\nOther sabermetrics work has identified important in-game factors that predict a starter’s replacement, such as the strike count, pitch count, number of outs, total batters faced, and current home runs conceded. However, pitching replacements have not been modeled as time-to-event outcomes. Instead, they have been modeled as binary outcomes. The advantage of timing models is that the cumulative effect of time is inherent; certain factors can expedite, or delay, the timing of the event. This process is also more realistic than a binary outcomes process, which considers each event independently.\nThe first question in this analysis is, what is the unit of time? For studying outcomes in medicine, time is often measured in months or years. However, in a baseball game, no more than a few hours go by, and typically the starting pitcher is replaced mid-way through the game. I chose to use the number of batters faced as the unit of time in this analysis. While this is not a measure of clock time, it is a measure of the number of opponents that the pitcher has faced. The higher the number of opponents, the more fatigued the pitcher will become. Alternatively one could consider the number of pitches thrown as the unit of time. I don’t see any issue with this, though pitcher replacements often happen between batter plate appearanced, and pitch-by-pitch data is much more granular, potentially complicating the analysis\nFor data, I used all postseason games from 2000-2019 (source: RetroSheet.org). There were several reasons for choosing these seasons and not including more recent seasons. First, the obvious complications of the COVID-19 pandemic make working with the 2020 postseason challenging. Secondly, a number of recent rule changes have been implemented which might influence the strategy around starting pitcher replacement, for example the pitch clock. Therefore I consider the 20-year window between 2000 and 2019 to be a relatively stable period of postseason play. Future work will have to revisit the same questions explored here and see if the underlying conclusions hold up in the modern era.\nI used Cox’s proportional hazards modeling approach and controlled for in-game strikeout rate, pitching volume (pitches thrown per batter faced), runners in scoring position, and home runs conceded, as well as differences across season eras and leagues. All of the covariates included in the model were computed sequentially for each batter faced. In other words, I did not use data from later in the game to inform a covariate value earlier in the game. I grouped seasons into five-year eras (e.g., 2000-2004), then analyzed the time-to-replacement for all starting pitchers in the dataset.\n\n\n\nI found that pitchers in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced earlier in the game, versus their counterparts in previous seasons. Below is an illustration of the ‘survival probability’, or the probability of remaining in the game for a starting pitcher from four different eras. It is clear that in the most-recent era (the purple line), starting pitchers had lower probabilities of remaining in the game at each number of batters faced (TBF). The p-value printed in the lower left is a result of comparing the four curves and assessing whether one or more curves differs from the rest. It is apparent that the difference in ‘survival’ in the 2015-2019 era, versus previous eras, was statistically significant.\n\n\n\nKaplan Meier curves illustrating probabilities of remaining in-game for starting pitchers in postseason games 2000-2019. The result of the log-rank test suggests a difference across season-eras.\n\n\nBelow are the model estimates for the effect of each covariate. For example, the Cox adjusted Hazard Ratio of Season era 2015-2019 (versus 2000-2004) was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16). This means that starting pitchers in the most-recent era were 169% more likely to be replaced against any given batter, versus the 2000-2004 era. The relatively narrow confidence interval tells us that the estimated hazard ratio is reliable, i.e., if we were to replay history we would likely obtain a similar estimate.\n\n\n\nEstimated hazard ratios for the ‘replacement factors’ of starting pitchers. The replacement factors are thought to influence the timing of pitcher replacements in the postseason. A hazard ratio greater than one indicates a higher likelihood of pitcher replacement.\n\n\nTo illustrate the magnitude of the season-era effect, consider a hypothetical pitcher playing in both the 2000-2004 and the 2000-2019 eras. Assuming typical starter performance (3.8 pitches per batter faced, strikeout rate of 20%), this pitcher has a 70.3% chance of pitching a third time through the order in 2000-2004 but only a 38.8% chance of doing so in 2015-2019. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively (with one home run conceded, the probabilities are similar). The probabilities below reflect the two scenarios, with the baseline scenario being no runners in scoring position (RISP) and no home runs conceded.\n\n\n\nPredicted probabilities of pitching a third time through the order for two hypothetical pitchers. The only difference between the pitchers is the era in which they play. The RISP scenario means at least one runner is in scoring position.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work quantifies trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not modeled in a time-to-event fashion. The model has drawbacks, in that it does not capture head-to-head matchup history or differing styles of management, but those factors will be included in future work."
