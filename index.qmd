# Current Work: SABR Analytics

The following work has been submitted for consideration at the [2024 SABR Analytics Conference](https://sabr.org/analytics) in Arizona.

The (working) title of the project is, *To take him out, or not: Modeling the timing of starting pitcher replacements in postseason games*.

## Executive Summary

In game seven of the 2003 ALCS, the Red Sox held a two-run lead in the eighth inning when manager Grady Little visited the mound[^1]. Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez was still in the game, with Hideki Matsui at the plate. Little decided to leave Martínez in for both Matsui and Jorge Posada, resulting in the loss of the lead and ultimately the game in 11 innings. At the time of Little’s mound visit, how likely was Martínez’s replacement? The following model suggests that Martínez would be pulled in 60.4% of games with similar circumstances. In postseason play, the timing of pulling a starter is the most crucial in-game decision faced by managers[^2]. Recent sabermetrics work has identified a trend towards earlier starting pitcher replacements in regular season[^3] [^4] [^5] and postseason   play[^6] [^7]. Previous work on the topic modeled the in-game performance of starting pitchers, using short-term forecasts to evaluate managerial decisions, and found that managers were too often leaving starters in the game longer than warranted by analytics[^8]. More recently, an evaluation of managers’ decisions found no biases in pulling pitchers too early or too late when considering effects on win probability[^3]. Other work has identified important in-game factors that predict a starter’s replacement, such as the strike count, pitch count, number of outs, total batters faced, and current home runs conceded[^9]. However, pitching replacements have not been modeled as time-to-event outcomes; instead, they have often been modeled as binary outcomes, as in machine learning[^3] [^9]. The advantage of timing models is that the cumulative effect of time is inherent; certain factors can expedite, or delay, the timing of the event. This process is more realistic than a binary outcomes model, which considers each event independently. I modeled the time-to-replacement for starting pitchers with time as the number of batters faced, using all postseason games from 2000-2019 (source: [RetroSheet.org](https://www.retrosheet.org/)). I used a flexible modeling approach that controls for in-game strikeout rate, pitching volume, runners in scoring position, and home runs conceded, as well as differences across season eras and leagues. I found that postseason starters in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced while facing any given batter, compared to starters in the 2000-2004 era (Cox adjusted Hazard Ratio[^10]: 2.69, 95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16). To illustrate the magnitude of this effect, consider a hypothetical pitcher playing in both eras. Assuming typical starter performance (3.8 pitches per batter faced, strikeout rate of 20%), this pitcher has a 70.3% chance of pitching a third time through the order in 2000-2004 but only a 38.8% chance of doing so in 2015-2019. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively (with one home run conceded, the probabilities are similar). This work quantifies trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not modeled in a time-to-event fashion. The model has drawbacks, in that it does not capture head-to-head matchup history or differing styles of management, but those factors will be included in future work.

**Research focus:** pitcher replacements, bullpen strategy, managerial decision-making.

## Results Overview

I grouped seasons into five-year eras, then analyzed the time-to-replacement in terms of total batters faced (TBF) for all starting pitchers in the postseason. I found that pitchers in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced earlier in the game, versus their counterparts in previous seasons.

Next I fit a model to the postseason data, with the outcome as time-to-replacement, and included several important competitive factors such as pitching volume (pitches thrown per batter faced), strikeout rate, runners in scoring position, and handedness (differing handedness between batter and pitcher). All of the factors were computed cumulatively, i.e., I did not use data from later in the game to predict a starter's replacement when facing a given batter. Additionally, I included season-eras and usage of designated hitters as factors in the model.

Finally, using the above model I estimated the chance of pitching a third time through the order (TTO) for two hypothetical starters in separate eras. The first pitcher is in the 2000-2004 era, when starters were expected to pitch relatively late in the game. The second pitcher is in the 2015-2019 era, when starters were replaced sooner in the game. The probabilities below reflect two scenarios, with the baseline scenario being no runners in scoring position (RISP) and no home runs conceded.
