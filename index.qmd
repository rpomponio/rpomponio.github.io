## Modeling the timing of starting pitcher replacements in postseason games

*The following work has been submitted for consideration at the 2024 SABR Analytics Conference in Phoenix, Arizona:* [conference page](https://sabr.org/analytics).

### Background

Recently a number of research papers have emerged examining the effects of starting pitcher replacements in Major League Baseball (MLB).[^1] [^2] This past year, the time through the order penalty (TTOP) was analyzed in a Bayesian framework and results were published in the Journal of Quantiative Analysis in Sports.[^3] There remain many questions about starting pitcher strategies, particularly in the postseason when managers' decisions are hyper-scrutinized.[^4] Despite a trend towards earlier starting pitcher replacements in both regular season[^5] [^6] and postseason[^7] [^8] play, I am not aware of any analysis that has considered the replacement of the starting pitcher as a time-to-event phenomenon. The field of biostatistics has benefited greatly from the ability to model time-to-event outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, within a regression framework outlined by the late David Cox.[^9] Cox's proportional hazards model is convenient for several reasons. It permits the formal modeling of a relationship between time and the event of interest; it incorporates covariates that increase or reduce the risk of the event; and, with modern software one can easily estimate the probability of an event occurring within a pre-specified time window. All of these characteristics are useful in the context of analyzing starting pitcher replacements. I will make the case that Cox's model is more suitable for modeling pitcher replacements than alternative approaches using classification or supervised machine learning techniques.

### Motivating Example

In game seven of the 2003 ALCS, the Red Sox held a two-run lead in the eighth inning when manager Grady Little visited the mound.[^10] Starting pitcher Pedro Martínez was still in the game, with Hideki Matsui at the plate. Little decided to leave Martínez in for both Matsui and Jorge Posada, resulting in the loss of the lead and ultimately the game in 11 innings. At the time of Little’s mound visit, how likely was Martínez’s replacement? The model that is developed below suggests that Martínez would be pulled in **60.4%** of games with similar circumstances.

### Methodology

Other work has identified important in-game factors that predict a starter’s replacement, such as the strike count, pitch count, number of outs, total batters faced, and current home runs conceded. However, pitching replacements have not been modeled as time-to-event outcomes; instead, they have often been modeled as binary outcomes. The advantage of timing models is that the cumulative effect of time is inherent; certain factors can expedite, or delay, the timing of the event. This process is more realistic than a binary outcomes model, which considers each event independently.

I modeled the time-to-replacement for starting pitchers with time in terms of total batters faced (TBF), using all postseason games from 2000-2019 (source: [RetroSheet.org](https://www.retrosheet.org/)). I used Cox's proportional hazards modeling approach and controlled for in-game strikeout rate, pitching volume (pitches thrown per batter faced), runners in scoring position, and home runs conceded, as well as differences across season eras and leagues.

All of the factors included as model covariates were computed sequentially for each batter faced, i.e., I did not use data from later in the game to inform a prediction earlier in the game. I grouped seasons into five-year eras, then analyzed the time-to-replacement for all starting pitchers in the postseason.

### Results Overview

I found that pitchers in the 2015-2019 era were far more likely to be replaced earlier in the game, versus their counterparts in previous seasons.

Below are the model estimates for the effect of each covariate. The Cox adjusted Hazard Ratio of Season era 2015-2019 (versus 2000-2004) was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.29 – 3.16).

To illustrate the magnitude of the season effect, consider a hypothetical pitcher playing in both eras. Assuming typical starter performance (3.8 pitches per batter faced, strikeout rate of 20%), this pitcher has a 70.3% chance of pitching a third time through the order in 2000-2004 but only a 38.8% chance of doing so in 2015-2019. With a runner in scoring position, these probabilities decline to 60.5% and 25.8%, respectively (with one home run conceded, the probabilities are similar). The probabilities below reflect the two scenarios, with the baseline scenario being no runners in scoring position (RISP) and no home runs conceded.

### Conclusions

This work quantifies trends in starting pitcher replacements that have been formerly described, but not modeled in a time-to-event fashion. The model has drawbacks, in that it does not capture head-to-head matchup history or differing styles of management, but those factors will be included in future work.
