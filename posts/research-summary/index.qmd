In this post, I review progress in my research so far, and distill my work into three themes spanning topics in biomedical sciences and applied statistics.

# 2018 to 2023: Five years of research, three themes

As we're nearing the end of the calendar year, I found it a good opportunity to present my research in this blog post and identify three different themes across the statistical and biomedical applications that I've worked on. Those themes are **computational**, **clinical**, and **missing data** methods. I've been fortunate to co-author a number of published papers over the past five years, and I've included links to relevant articles where they fit within the above themes. I'll cover each theme in more detail below.

## Theme 1: Computational Research

### Computational Neuroimaging and Related Challenges

In 2018, I began working at [CBICA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/), a computational neuroimaging lab at the University of Pennsylvania, led by Dr. Christos Davatzikos. At CBICA, I developed an early expertise in statistical image analysis, particularly in normalizing imaging-derived features over multiple scanners and diverse geographic sites. In the imaging literature, this is referred to as [harmonization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006851#:~:text=Harmonization%20is%20typically%20performed%20to,downstream%20application%20performance%20during%20harmonization.), and there are a growing number of techniques available to implement harmonization. My most significant contribution was in developing a tool that adapted the popular ComBat[^1] algorithm to lifespan datasets encompassing broad age ranges, with potentially complex age trends in brain volumetry. Today, that tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize) as a `python` package, and it is used by neuroimaging researchers to handle common harmonization tasks like removing site effects in regional brain volumes data.

In addition to my work on harmonization, I assisted with image analysis in several other projects that resulted in peer-reviewed publications from the following first authors:

* [Dr. Ilya M. Nasrallah](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20000440/p9094), Associate Professor of Radiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania
* [Dr. Mohamad Habes](https://www.nallab.org/pi), Assistant Professor, Departments of Radiology and Epidemiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio
* Dr. Ganesh Chand, Assistant Professor at Washington University in St. Louis
* Vishnu M. Bashyam, PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania

## Theme 2: Clinical Research

### Pulmonary and Critical Care Collaborations

In 2021, under Dr. Ryan Peterson, I joined Colorado School of Public Health's [PTraC](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/pulmonary/research/ptrac) Team, which specializes in statistical research services for the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Colorado. I was fortunate to work with excellent clinical collaborators at PTraC, including several specialists in lung transplant, severe asthma, and pulmonary hypertension. My work was characterized by generalist applications of regression models to observational data. Data types were highly heterogeneous and included electronic health records, insurance claims, and a national disease registry. Among the more common methods I used were survival analysis and longitudinal modeling, two popular frameworks for fitting regressions to biomedical datasets. While at PTraC, I was selected to present a lightning talk on my work at the 2022 [Symposium on Statistics and Data Science](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2022/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?AbstractID=310166) in Pittsburgh.

## Theme 3: Missing Data Methods

The last theme of my research deals with missing data. Missing data are common yet complicated by enormous heterogeneity; missing data can arise at various stages within a study, and they present so many challenges that practitioners often ignore missing data altogether. In my work at Colorado, I encountered missing data in observational studies due to participant dropout or early mortality. When working with this kind of missing data, I often used multiple imputation by chained equations[^2] to replace missing observations with values that would be realistic given the remaining data. This technique works well when certain assumptions are met and is conveniently implemented in`R` by the [mice](https://github.com/amices/mice) package.

However, another kind of missing data can arise in studies investigating pre-post differences that fail to collect unique identifiers for each participant. For my master's thesis at Colorado, I analyzed techniques to handle this particular case of paired inference, which we refer to as 'partially matched' data. My work on this subject is currently under review, but the pre-print is below, co-authored by my thesis committee:

* [Dr. Bailey K. Fosdick](https://www.baileyfosdick.com), Associate Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Informatics in the Colorado School of Public Health

## Conclusions and Next Steps

Looking back at the past five years, it's clear that I've primarily worked on academic research projects focusing on biomedical diseases and potential health interventions. Broadly, I've developed an expertise as a biostatistician and data scientist in many medical research contexts.

If I am to speculate on the direction of the next five years, I would predict much of the same kind of work, but with expansions into new contexts such as business and sports analytics. These areas excite me by presenting an opportunity to integrate my undergraduate business experience with cutting-edge data science methods. I've begun to work a little in these areas as an independent consultant through [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01bb85ee6f09078536), and I hope that I can continue to find clients valuing my insight on diverse and wide-ranging projects.

In 2024, I look forward to beginning a new position as a data scientist at [SygnaMap](https://www.sygnamap.com), a bio-tech startup based in San Antonio. At SygnaMap I will be helping to develop novel biomarkers using metabolomic profiles, which will draw on many of my past experiences including computational complexity, clinical utility, and challenges arising from missing data.
