## Survival Analysis: A brief overview

The goal of survival analysis is to understand the factors that lead to earlier (or later) event times. In a medical context, the event is often mortality (i.e., death of the patient). In this sense, medical researchers are typically most-concerned with the factors that lead to earlier mortality, or *longer* survival, hence the name 'survival' analysis.

Survival analysis is particularly useful when studying time-related phenomena with many possible risk factors, and when observational data are available. In professional sports, risk factors might be understood as game situations, i.e., what situations lead to a higher chance of the outcome? Data availability is usually not an issue, since events are now tracked to the play-level, and sometimes even greater levels of granularity.

There aren't many examples of survival analysis applied to baseball, though one example studied how the length of player careers varied based upon the handedness of the player.[^1] In that example, the event of interest was the end of the player's career; the unit of time was days. This analysis could help questions like, which throwing handedness tends to yield longer careers in the major leagues? (Spoiler: the author found that right-handed throwers teneded to last a little longer than lefties, on average).

Survival analysis includes a lot of the same features of linear regression. Linear regression is used in advanced metrics to adjust for factors like league-to-leage variability or positional differences.[^2] Importantly, survival analysis extends that framework to study events that are time-dependent, like the length of a player's career. Studying career lengths with linear regression might be prone to certain kinds of bias, since career lengths are not normally-distributed.[^3]

In the next section I will describe the data that were prepared to analyze starting pitcher replacements in the postseason.

## Data: Play-by-play from Retrosheet

For this analysis, I used play-by-play data from Retrosheet[^4] to construct a set of starting pitcher histories in the postseason. This required parsing the play-by-play events to identify game situations, such as the number of runners on base. It also required processing roster information to identify the handedness of the pitchers and batters they faced. In fact this data cleaning process was a heavy lift, since the play-by-play data are minimally-structured and contain only enough information to re-create the context of a particular game once a considerable amount of processing has been applied. Documentation for the play-by-play files is available[^5] and was extremely helpful in this early stage of the analysis.

I chose to focus on the twenty postseasons between 2000 and 2019. This was for a few reasons. First, the more-recent postseasons since 2019 have been impacted by COVID-19 and major rule changes. I wanted to ensure my analysis was not complicated by any of those impacts. Secondly, the postseasons before 2000 are now so long ago that strategies around managing a starting pitcher are substantially different. Thus, I focus on 2000-2019 as a relatively stable, modern 'era' of postseason play. Within this window there were 611 postseason games available to analyze.

Here's what every postseason game log contains, after data processing was performed:

* League (e.g., NL/AL/World Series)
* Playoff round
* Playoff game number
* The starting pitcher for each team
* A record of all plate appearances facing each starter, and outcomes (e.g., home-run, fly out)
* A running tally of the number of pitches thrown by each starter
* A running tally of the number of strikeouts achieved by each starter
* The handedness of the pitcher and batter

The above list is incomplete since it does not contain crucial variables like the matchup history between a given batter and pitcher. However, I felt that the list was sufficient for beginning an inquiry into starting pitchers and the factors that affect their replacement. In the next few sections, I will define the key variables of interest for the analysis.

## Defining the Event of Interest

In the playoffs, the timing of replacing the starting pitcher is one of the most crucial decisons faced by managers. Here is what sportswriter Jasyon Stark wrote about "hooks" in the wake of a catastrophic collapse of the Red Sox's pitching in game seven of the 2003 ALCS:

> For managers and the pitchers they manage, this is *the* question: Take him out, or leave him in? It is the question that hangs over every manager every game of every season. It is the question that leaves canyons under their eyes and fault lines in their forehead.[^6]

Red Sox manager Grady Little had just been fired after the team ended their season on a blown lead against the Yankees. Little's decision to leave Pedro Martinez on the mound in the eighth inning was the turning point that contributed to their loss.

In the modern era, complete games are increasingly rare. In the dataset described in the previous section, of the 1218 starts analyzed, only 33 (2.7%) resulted in complete games. Thus managers are usually grappling with *when* to pull the starter, not *if* they should pull the starter. Of course, in the heat of the moment of a playoff game, this decision can resemble the form of a binary choice for each batter faced. In that sense, it's like flipping a coin at the beginning of each plate appearance; the coin in this analogy has a low probability of coming up tails. The manager keeps flipping the coin, and it continues to show heads, until a later moment in the game when it shows tails. The first time this happens, the starter is pulled.

I'm not suggesting that managers are actually flipping coins to guide their highly consequential decisions, but to an outside observer, the process of starting pitcher replacements can be modeled as a series of random coin tosses. That is what I will do in this analysis. I will define the event of interest as the replacement of the starter, and I will model the timing of that event using information available throughout the game, including the in-game performance of the pitcher and the opposing team's offense.

Next I will define the unit of time that's used to measure how late into the game a starter will last.
