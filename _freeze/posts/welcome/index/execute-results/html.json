Those themes are: **computational**, **clinical**, and **missing data methods**. I'll cover each theme in more detail below. I've been fortunate to co-author a number of published papers over the past five years, and I'll include links to relevant articles where they fit within the above themes.\n\n### Theme 1: Research in Computational Neuroimaging\n\n![Figure from Pomponio et al. (2020): Age trends for selected brain volumes using a statistically harmonized dataset with 18 studies spanning the age range 3â€“96.](trends.jpeg)\n\nIn 2018, I began working at [CBICA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/), a computational neuroimaging lab at the University of Pennsylvania, led by Dr. Christos Davatzikos. At CBICA, I developed an early expertise in statistical image analysis, particularly in the challenges of normalizing imaging-derived features over multiple scanners and geographic sites. In the imaging literature, this is referred to as [harmonization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922006851#:~:text=Harmonization%20is%20typically%20performed%20to,downstream%20application%20performance%20during%20harmonization.), and there are a growing number of techniques available to implement harmonization techniques. My major contribution was to develop a tool that adapted the popular ComBat[^1] algorithm to lifespan datasets encompassing vast age ranges, with potentially complex age trends in brain volumetry. Today, that tool is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rpomponio/neuroHarmonize) as a python package, and it is used by neuroimaging researchers to handle common harmonization tasks like removing site effects.\n\nIn addition to my work on harmonization, I assisted with image analysis in several other projects that resulted in peer-reviewed publications by the following first authors:\n\n* [Dr. Ilya M. Nasrallah](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g20000440/p9094), Associate Professor of Radiology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania\n* [Dr. Mohamad Habes](https://www.nallab.org/pi), Assistant Professor, Departments of Radiology and Epidemiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio\n* Dr. Ganesh Chand, Assistant Professor at Washington University in St. Louis\n* Vishnu M. Bashyam, PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n```{html}\n<div class=\"accordion\" id=\"accordionExample\">\n  <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n    <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"headingOne\">\n      <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"#collapseOne\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"collapseOne\">\n        Accordion Item #1\n      </button>\n    </h2>\n    <div id=\"collapseOne\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingOne\" data-bs-parent=\"#accordionExample\" style=\"\">\n      <div class=\"accordion-body\">\n        <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element.
